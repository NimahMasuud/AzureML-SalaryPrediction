Salary Prediction Web Application 🌟
This project is a fully functional Salary Prediction Web Application powered by Machine Learning and hosted using Flask. 
It's designed to predict an employee's salary based on various key factors such as Age, Gender, Education Level, Job Title, and Years of Experience.

🌟 Key Features:
User-Friendly Interface: A clean and intuitive form for data input, ensuring a seamless user experience.
Real-Time Predictions: Uses Azure ML's powerful inference endpoint for fast and accurate salary predictions.
Customizable Framework: Built with Flask, making it easy to extend and deploy.
Industry-Relevant: Demonstrates practical integration of machine learning into real-world use cases.

💡 Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Jinja2 templates.
Backend: Python, Flask, REST API.
Machine Learning: Azure ML endpoint for robust model serving.
Deployment Ready: Locally hosted with Flask for demonstration; can be easily extended to production environments.

🚀 Quick Start Guide
Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set Up Environment Variables:
Replace api_key in test.py with your Azure ML API key.
Alternatively, store the key in an environment variable for better security.
Run the Application:
python test.py
Access the Application:
Open your browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.

🎯 How It Works:
Input Details: Enter the required employee details (age, gender, education level, etc.) in the form.
Submit the Form: The data is sent to an Azure ML inference endpoint using secure API calls.
Receive Predictions: The model processes the input and predicts the salary in real time.
View Results: The predicted salary is displayed on the same page.
